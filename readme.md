# Getting Started With Flask (Mega Tutorial)

Just note talking on Flask Mega Tutorial by Miguel.

Download Python3 (with Brew)

Create application folder and cd into it

Create a virtual environment and install flask in it (python3)
> python3 -m venv flask

To avoid the upgrade recomendation

> flask/bin/pip install --upgrade pip

### Dependencies

```shell
flask/bin/pip install flask
flask/bin/pip install flask-login
flask/bin/pip install flask-openid
